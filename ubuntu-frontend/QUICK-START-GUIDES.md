## ✍️ Writing Your Short Introduction

This is the MOST IMPORTANT text - it appears on the homepage!

### Good Examples ✅
- "Expert in gorilla trekking and wildlife safaris across Rwanda"
- "Cultural heritage specialist and mountain hiking expert"
- "Safari expert with deep knowledge of Maasai Mara ecosystem"
- "Kilimanjaro climbing specialist and Serengeti safari guide"

### Bad Examples ❌
- "I am a tour guide" (too generic)
- "Contact me for tours" (not descriptive)
- "Best guide in Africa" (sounds fake)
- Long paragraphs (keep it to 1-2 sentences)

### Formula
**"[Specialty] + [Experience/Location]"**

Examples:
- "Wildlife photographer and safari guide in Tanzania"
- "Certified mountain guide specializing in Kilimanjaro treks"
- "Cultural tour expert with 15 years in Rwanda"

## 📝 Writing Your Full Biography

This appears on your dedicated bio page. Make it personal and compelling!

### Structure
1. **Opening** - Who you are and what you do
2. **Experience** - How long, what you've done
3. **Passion** - Why you love guiding
4. **Specialties** - What makes you unique
5. **Call to Action** - Invite them to book

### Example
```
With over 10 years of experience guiding tourists through Rwanda's 
stunning landscapes, I specialize in gorilla trekking expeditions in 
Volcanoes National Park. 

My journey began as a park ranger, where I developed a deep 
understanding of Rwanda's wildlife and ecosystems. Today, I combine 
this knowledge with my passion for storytelling to create 
unforgettable experiences for visitors from around the world.

I speak English, French, and Kinyarwanda fluently, allowing me to 
connect with diverse groups of travelers. Whether you're seeking 
adventure, wildlife photography, or cultural immersion, I'll ensure 
your Rwanda experience exceeds expectations.

Let's explore the land of a thousand hills together!
